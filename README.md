EEG Psychiatric Disorders Dashboard

📊 Project Overview
This project visualizes and predicts major psychiatric disorders based on EEG (Electroencephalography) signals. It includes interactive dashboards and a deep learning-based prediction module using EEG band powers and coherence features.

Data Source: Resting-State EEG signals dataset from Kaggle.

Tech Stack: Streamlit, PyTorch, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn.

🚀 Features
Interactive visualizations for EEG data:

Band power histograms

Coherence maps

Topographic maps (brain-like plots)

t-SNE embeddings

Prediction Module:

Upload 226-feature EEG data to predict disorders.

Quick predict using band-mean sliders.

🎯 How to Use
Visit the Live App.

Explore visual dashboards for various psychiatric disorders.

Use the Predict Disorder tab to:

Upload EEG features.

Or use sliders to simulate EEG band values.
